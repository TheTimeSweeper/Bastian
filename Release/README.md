# The Rogue Translator
- Adds Bastian, a rogue translator bot, pulled from the standby crew of the UES to fight in the fields of Petrichor V.
- Bastian is a high-stress survivor, meant for players who want to try a new style of combat. Not having been built for fighting, his new systems are somewhat unstable, leaving him vulnerable early on. He has to be careful when he first arrives on the planet, as one stray Golem beam, or one unaccounted-for pest, and it's system shutdown.

# Special Thanks to

Nunchuk - Being so willing to help fix an issue with emote compat, and on such a sudden notice as well
My friends Gwen and Phoebe - For listening to me ramble on about my ideas for the mod, and offering input as the development went on.

# To The Team
This one is important to me. It's been an interesting process as this went on, and everyone has been so fun to work with on all this, it lead to some friendships I didn't even expect. You all did some amazing work here, and as the mod is finally going up, I hope everyone involved can look at this and feel proud of what they contributed. I couldn't have found a better group of people to work on this if I tried, and I appreciate everything you guys have done.

From the bottom of my heart; Thank you.
